To set a strong foundation, this section outlines how we, the community and members of Infisical,
should approach the development and contribution process.

## Infisical Codebases

Infisical project encompasses two major codebases: one for the platform code, and one for SDKs. The two code-bases have key differences in their contribution processes, please refer to respective documentation sections below :

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Infisical Platform" href="/contributing/platform/developing" icon="layer-group" color="#A1B659">
    The Infisical platform is the core of the Infisical ecosystem.
  </Card>

  <Card href="/contributing/sdk/developing" title="Infisical SDK" icon="code" color="#A1B659">
    The SDKs are the official Infisical client libraries, used by developers to easily interact with the Infisical platform.

## Prerequisites for contributing

### Understanding the terms

In the guide we use some terms that might be unfamiliar to you. Here's a quick explanation of the terms we use:

* **Base SDK**: The base SDK is the SDK that all other SDK's are built on top of. The base SDK is written in Rust, and is responsible for executing commands and parsing the input and output to and from JSON.

* **Commands**: Commands are what's being sent from the target language to the command handler. The command handler uses the command to execute the corresponding function in the base SDK. Commands are in reality just a JSON string that tells the command handler what function to execute, and what input to use.

* **Command handler**: The command handler is the part of the base SDK that takes care of executing commands. It also takes care of parsing the input and output to and from JSON.

* **Target language**: The target language refers to the actual SDK code. For example, the [Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@infisical/sdk) is a "target language", and so is the [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/infisical-python/).

### Understanding the execution flow

After the target language SDK is initiated, it uses language-specific bindings to interact with the base SDK.
These bindings are instantiated, setting up the interface for command execution. A client within the command handler is created, which issues commands to the base SDK.
When a command is executed, it is first validated. If valid, the command handler locates the corresponding command to perform. If the command executes successfully, the command handler returns the output to the target language SDK, where it is parsed and returned to the user.
If the command handler fails to validate the input, an error will be returned to the target language SDK.

### Rust knowledge

Contributing to the SDK requires intermediate to advanced knowledge of Rust concepts such as lifetimes, traits, generics, and async/await *(futures)*, and more.

### Rust setup

The base SDK is written in rust. Therefore you must have rustc and cargo installed. You can install rustc and cargo by following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

You shouldn't have to use the rust cross compilation toolchain, as all compilation is done through a collection of Github Actions. However. If you need to test cross compilation, please do so with Github Actions.

## Community

We are building an inclusive community, and this means adhering to the [Code of Conduct](/contributing/getting-started/code-of-conduct).

## Bugs and issues

Bug reports help make Infisical a better experience for everyone. When you report a bug, a template will be created automatically containing information we'd like to know.

Before raising a new issue, please search existing ones to make sure you're not creating a duplicate.

<Info>
  If the issue is related to security, please email us directly at
  team@infisical.com.

## Deciding what to work on

You can start by browsing through our list of issues or adding your own that improves on the platform experience. Once you've decided on an issue, leave a comment and wait to get approved; this helps avoid multiple people working on the same issue.

If you're ever in doubt about whether or not a proposed feature aligns with Infisical as a whole, feel free to raise an issue about it and we'll get back to you promptly.

## Writing and submitting code

Anyone can contribute code to Infisical. To get started, check out the local development guides for each language.

* Local development guide for Platform is [here](/contributing/platform/developing).

* Local development guide for SDK is [here](/contributing/sdk/developing).

## Licensing

Most of Infisical's code is under the MIT license, though some paid feature restrictions are covered by a proprietary license.

Any third party components incorporated into our code are licensed under the original license provided by the applicable component owner.
